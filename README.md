# Neighborhood Tool Time

---

### Neighborhood Tool Time is a Ruby on Rails app that was designed to be used by neighborhoods. Neighbors sign up for the app and then add tools, equipiment, etc. that they own. Other neighbors can then sign up to borrow tools from their neighbors.

This app was inspired by my neighbor. Within the same week we had both needed a wheel barrow for landscape projects. He casually mentioned that someone in the neighborhood has to have one and how it would be great if there was an app to be able to see if a neighbor had a wheel barrow to borrow.
